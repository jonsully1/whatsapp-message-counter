# WhatsApp Message Counter
This repo provides a Python and Node scipt to count the number of messages sent by each participant in a WhatsApp chat. The tool processes a .txt file of WhatsApp chat history and outputs the total number of messages as well as a breakdown of messages sent by each participant.

## How to use

2. Export the chat as a .txt file (i.e. `whatsapp_chat.txt`) and save it in the same directory as this repo.
4. Run with Python or Node:

```bash
python3 wamessage-counter.py whatsapp_chat.txt
```

```bash
node wamessage-counter.py whatsapp_chat.txt
```

## Example output

```bash
‚ùØ node wamessage-counter.js whatsapp_chat.txt
